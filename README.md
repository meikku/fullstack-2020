# fullstack-2020

As a part of the curriculum for Centria's 'Road to software engineering' -program I studied this open MOOC course (parts 0-7) by Helsinki University:

## Deep Dive Into Modern Web Development - Full Stack open

This course serves as an introduction to modern web application development with JavaScript. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js. 
The course covers testing, configuration and environment management, and the use of MongoDB for storing the applicationâ€™s data.
The course is worth 5-13 credits. Parts 0-8 and 13 of the course material is written by Matti Luukkainen. 

Participants are expected to have good programming skills, basic knowledge of web programming and databases, and to know the basics of working with the Git version-control system. You are also expected to have perseverance and the ability for independent problem solving and information seeking.
